# My AWS Cloud Projects

Cloud computing is a bustling topic in the infotech right now. Imagine you are renting a running personal computer in your home, this is what a cloud computing is all about. Rather than purchasing, operating, and maintaining physical data centers and servers you can obtain technology services, such processing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS offers the widest variety of databases that are purpose-built for different types of applications so you can choose the right tool for the job to get the best cost and performance.

In this section, it revolves the cloud projects I made using Amazon Web Services. I have demonstrated here the step by step procedure on how to make a cloud project from scratch and be able to implement them on the cloud without any problems. As an aspiring cloud engineer, I have created this repository so that the future junior Cloud Engineers would be able to access this and view my tutorials and notes that discussed some of the cloud projects I have done which would be really be helpful in their journey to cloud.
